𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: 𝗛𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟰 𝗮𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁!



Time to switch gears from hackathons to open source—one of the absolute best decisions I made as a developer!



Last year, I participated in 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁 and hit 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟰 (𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹!). That meant going above and beyond: not just opening PRs for the badge, but truly collaborating, reviewing code, and contributing to real-world projects that people around the globe rely on.

What did I gain?

- 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Open source isn’t just about code—it’s about reading other people’s work, following standards, and building things that actually help.

- 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆: Working with maintainers and contributors from all over the world taught me more than any class could. Good feedback (and sometimes tough reviews!) really pushes you.

- 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁: There’s an insane feeling knowing your code might be helping someone you’ve never met.



Honestly, jumping into open source changed my approach to every college project that followed. Whether it’s writing better documentation, managing issues, or even just communicating online, those skills carried over everywhere.



If you’ve ever been on the fence about contributing, my advice? Jump in. The first PR is intimidating, but the community is crazy supportive.
